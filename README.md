# GANs from Scratch â€” Self-Implemented Generative Adversarial Network

This repository contains a self-implementation of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** using **PyTorch**. The project covers:

- **Generator** and **Discriminator** networks built from scratch with convolutional layers.
- **Binary Cross Entropy with Logits** loss function for stable GAN training.
- Training on the **MNIST dataset**, generating realistic handwritten digits.
- Real-time monitoring of **training and validation losses**.
- Visualization of generated images at each epoch.

This implementation offers a hands-on approach to understanding the core principles of GANs and is a great starting point for learning generating models
