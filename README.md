# GANs from Scratch

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** from scratch using PyTorch. The GAN model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** to generate realistic handwritten digits.

The goal of this project is educationalâ€”it's designed as a hands-on introduction to GAN architectures, training dynamics, and implementing in PyTorch
